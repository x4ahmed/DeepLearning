# Hypothesis Space

Welcome to my **Hypothesis Space**! ðŸŒŒ This repository is meant to explore and solve a variety of exercises in **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Advanced Programming Algorithms**, and **Mathematics for AI** using Python.

## About

This repository serves as a personal sandbox for experimenting with AI, data science, and algorithmic problems. My goal is to deepen understanding of core concepts while applying them to practical Python exercises.  

This repository may provide useful code examples and learning material for you.

## Topics Covered

- **Machine Learning**: Supervised and unsupervised learning, model evaluation, feature engineering.  
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, PyTorch/TensorFlow implementations.  
- **Advanced Programming Algorithms**: Dynamic programming, graph algorithms, optimization, complexity analysis.  
- **Mathematics for AI**: Linear algebra, probability, calculus, statistics, and other foundational math exercises.
